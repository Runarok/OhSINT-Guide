# tryhackme-writeups

My evolving notes and walkthroughs for the **TryHackMe OhSINT** lab — every step, command, and insight I explored is documented here.

## 📌 Update

I spent a few days exploring [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), and while it's a great platform, I’ve run into quite a few **premium content restrictions**. There are free labs available, but I found it a bit difficult to discover and access the ones that truly matched what I was looking for.

As a result, I'm putting this repository **on hiatus**.

I may return to it occasionally — either when I feel like it, want to revisit specific content, or once I’m in a better financial position to justify investing in the premium version. Until then, my focus will shift to **other points of interest**.
